  <p>This is my favorite recipe because it has become a staple of my community, feeding many impoverished black families for generations. My grandmother will be 98 years old in 90 days. She often reminds me of how much things were different in her day when black people in America were not afforded educational/economic opportunity because of racism and poverty and institutional racism. She tells me how little things like food were a big deal, and cornbread was a meal by itself, and Blue/Raspberry Cornbread with butter was every poor black child's favorite treat.</p>
