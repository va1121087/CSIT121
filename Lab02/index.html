<p> This is my favorite recipe because it has become a staple of my community, feeding many improverished black families for generations. My grandmother will be 98 years old on 90 days. She oftern reminds me of how much things were different in her day when black people in America were not afforded educational/economic opportunity beacuse of racism and poverty and institutional racism. She tells me how little things like food were a big deal , and cornbreadbread was a meal by itself, and Blue/Raspbery Cornbread with butter was every poor black child's favorite treat.</p>
